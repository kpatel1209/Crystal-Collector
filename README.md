Crystal Collector

A random number will generate at the start of each game.

The four crystals you see below each store a random number between 1 - 12. You must click on them to find out the number, which will also increase your total score for the round.

You will win the game by clicking on the diamonds and getting your total score to match with the random number selected by the game.

You will loose the game if your score goes above the random number picked by the game.

When the game restarts, the value of the crystals will change as well.
